# Shapes

## Summary

Shapes is a simple app to help users of all ages develop their own toys with circles and rectangles.

A user clicks on a button to add a rectangle or circle and it will magically appear on the canvas. The shape can then be dragged across the canvas to a new position. If a shape is selected, its color and size can be altered through the form that appears on the side of the canvas. A shape can also be deleted from the canvas through a delete button at the top of the form.

If you would like to drag more than one shape at a time, select the first shape that you would like to be repositioned. Then hold down the shift key and click the next shape that you would like to be selected, allowing more than one shape to be highlighted. Then simply drag the shapes to their new position.

## Install and Run

This application was built using Vanilla Javascript without the use of any gems or other frameworks. Just open the Shapes.html file in your local browser and enjoy making new toys for future generations to play with.
